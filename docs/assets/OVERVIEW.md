# Assets Documentation Overview

## Purpose

Use this entrypoint before changing asset loading, asset metadata, project asset import, package asset export, font/material asset lookup, or typed asset-manager behavior.

## Current Documents

- `docs/assets/plans/TYPED_ASSET_MANAGER_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` describes the planned typed asset-manager facade and loader boundaries.
- `docs/engine/ASSET.md` describes the authoring asset entity, editor behavior, validation, runtime/export status, and implementation files.
- `docs/runtime/PACKAGE_EXPORT.md` describes runtime package layout and manifest shape.
- `docs/editor/export/EXPORT_AND_PACKAGING.md` describes the editor export workflow and asset packaging surface.

## Code Areas

- `engine/src/assets/` and related engine headers own runtime asset loading behavior.
- `editor/src/shared/project-schema/authoring-assets*` and editor asset operations own authoring asset schema/commands.
- `editor/src/renderer/editors/assets/` owns the asset library/editor UI.
- Runtime export/package builders live under editor services and shared export code.

## Agent Rules

Do not add a new asset lookup path without documenting ownership, path safety, runtime/export behavior, and editor diagnostics.

When changing authoring asset shape, update `docs/engine/ASSET.md`. When changing runtime asset loading or package layout, update the runtime/export docs as well.
